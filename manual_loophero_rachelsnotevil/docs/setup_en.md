# Manual Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Archipelago
- Loop Hero (any platform should suffice)
- Manual for Archipelago (not needed for generation, *I think,* but needed for the Manual Client)

## Installation Procedures

Open the Archipelago launcher, choose "install apworld" and select the file "manual_loophero_rachelsnotevil.apworld". You may need to restart the launcher afterward.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

First obtain a yaml, either by downloading and editing the default yaml or, after installing the apworld, choosing "generate template options" and finding the template yaml in your Players/Templates folder.

The person generating the multiworld and anyone playing Loop Hero will need the manual Loop Hero apworld installed. The person generating the game will then need to have all players' yamls in the Players folder and choose "Generate" in the Archipelago launcher. It's recommended you then host on Archipelago.gg by choosing "Start Playing" and "host a pre-generated game". When it asks for a file, the host should supply the file that was created in their "output" folder.

When you want to join a game in which you're playing Loop Hero, just open the Manual Client from the Archipelago launcher and enter your information from the room.
